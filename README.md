## Intro:
We intend to create a game to alleviate the rising problem of depression in Singaporeans. Initially, there will be 3 standard images shown on the projector and players will have to align themselves to the poses.Thereafter, players are supposed to create one of their own poses. The pose created by the new player will replace one of the standard 3 images and be used for the next player, such that there will be different, interesting type of poses. Using computer vision (Peeking duck), it will detect whether the playersâ€™ pose is aligned to the hole. There is a maximum of 1 player for each round. At the end of the game, the player will receive a score. As an incentive, vouchers will be given to players who are able to get 70% and above.
